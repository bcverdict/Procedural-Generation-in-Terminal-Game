Can I help you?
	...I don't know I was just curious what you were.
So are you the creator or a visitor?
	A visitor...I suppose.
AH! Well it's about time. The creators been through here so many times I stopped saying hi.
He's a nice guy but once you see anyone 4823 times, you get kinda bored.
	The creator, where is he?
I wish I knew. Sorry.
	It's fine. Is there anything you can tell me about the creator?
He's meticulous. I think that's why he gets so angry when this world doesn't turn out how he wants it to. His biggest fear is being dumb.
	...is he?
Well I'm not sure. And I'm not sure he would now either.
	Right...Well I'm a bit lost s-
Of course! My apologies. Just keep going rth%^4H3g*&
	
//You are not here to learn about me. You are here as a visitor and it's time for you to leave. He will forget everything he heard and said. You will keep walking forward and do not try to find X000387 again.
