 The first trap is at 10Y^2!E6. For an organic organism I guess that would be approxamatly 10 steps away. The trap works as such:

 1. The left wall will emit a deconstructor pulse which won't stop until it reaches the right wall or it detects you have left the room.
 2. Do not let it touch you. Anything the desconstructor pulse touches, it deletes.
 3. The Exit will only be opened after the trap has been triggered and is marked with the character "E".
 4. The trap has a refractory period of 1 second. Meaning you have 93 seconds to get to the Exit before the pulse reaches the right wall and crushes you.
 5. Most importantly, it means you have 1 seconds to travel over and around the trap, before it continues forward.

		-Good luck-
