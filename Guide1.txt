 The first trap is at 10Y^2!E6. But if you are organic, it is 10 approxamatly 10 steps away. The trap works as such:
 1. The left wall will emit a deconstructor pulse. It will look as though a wall is generated at the left wall
 and traveling to the right wall.
 2. Do not let it touch you. Anything the desconstructor pulse touches, it deletes.
 3. The button to turn the trap off is on the other side of the wall marcked with the character "E".
 4. The trap has a refractory period of 1 seconds. Meaning you have 30 seconds to find and press the exit.
 5. More importantly, it means you have 1 seconds to travel over and around the trap, before it continues forward.

		-Good luck-
