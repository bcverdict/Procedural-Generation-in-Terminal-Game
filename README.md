### Ncurses UI
Taught myself the Ncurses API in order to make this idea possible.

### Politeness is rewarded
In this game how you interact with the character(also called Mr.T) matters. As you can see in this picture below
you can be given a guide to the next trap if you are very polite. 
To see how your conversation effects the game and how our fictitious Mr.T responds, look in the [Design.cpp](https://github.com/bcverdict/Procedural-Generation-in-Terminal-Game/blob/master/Dialog.cpp) file.

### Animations
At the end of the game, win or lose, you will be presented with a handmade animation of the title EXIT turn into a door.

### Music
Music is also present in the game but for copyright reasons I cannot upload it to github.
